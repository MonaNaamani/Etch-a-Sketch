# Etch-a-Sketch

## Description:
The Etch A Sketch project is a web-based application developed as part of The Odin Project curriculum. Inspired by the classic mechanical drawing toy, this project showcases my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.

## Features:

- Sketching Canvas: Users can draw freehand on a virtual canvas using their mouse or touch input.
- Adjustable Grid: The application allows users to change the grid size, providing control over the level of detail in their sketches.

## Upcoming Features:

- Color Selection: Users will be able to choose different colors to draw with, enhancing their creative possibilities.
- Clear and Reset: The option to clear the entire canvas or start over with a new grid will be available soon.

## How to Use:
You can access and start drawing on the virtual canvas by clicking [here](https://monanaamani.github.io/Etch-a-Sketch/)! Feel free to experiment with different grid sizes to unleash your creativity.
